<p>Hello there!  My name is Jason Berry and I am a computer scientist working in the field of web application development.  What does this mean?  To recruiters, this means that I’m a full stack engineer, but to me it means that I take a problem facing people in the real world and solve it using whatever tools are necessary to get the job done.  </p>

<p>Since the start of my career, I’ve actively tried to keep an open mind in technology and approach. This is something that I believe is very difficult for most passionate programmers to do. It means being humble and listening to other people’s opinions even when you think or know they are wrong. It means that you must do your own research and experimentation with unfamiliar technologies. It means that you need to be self conscious enough to realize when you’re making assumptions. It means you need to be clever enough to test those assumptions.  I feel as though this is something I do very well.</p>

<p>This blog is a window into my career and personal life as I continue to develop as a software developer, scientist, and self declared entrepreneur. I will be covering topics ranging from software engineering to theoretical physics to the next groundbreaking startup ideas. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I’ve enjoyed writing about the topics that I find fascinating.</p>
