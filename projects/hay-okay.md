[HayOkay.com](http://www.hayokay.com) is an exclusive startup idea which I'm seeking funding to build. HayOkay is targeted towards small farmers (both crop and livestock farmers) who are looking to further their sales efforts using new mobile technologies.

The inspiration came from an idea that my dad had several years ago. As a farmer, my father spent a lot of time at the local markets selling his hay and corn. After his produce sells, he spends between 30 and 45 minutes waiting in line to get paid. He asked me "Is there any way to make an electronic system which managed payments so I could get paid and out the door faster?" Now fast forward a couple of years... after researching auction software and the agricultural market I've come up with a product idea.

HayOkay serves two customer groups. Hay farmers and livestock farmers. You can think of it as a Seamless application for farm animals!
